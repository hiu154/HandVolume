# HandVolume
A Python project that uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to recognize hand gestures in real time and control the system volume. Pinch or move your fingers to increase or decrease volume just by moving your hand in front of the camera. Perfect for automation, accessibility, or touchless control experiments.
